# Duolingo-Community-

This project presents a conceptual redesign and feature proposal for the Duolingo platform. The core concept introduces a "Community" module, integrating features such as dedicated study groups, collaborative challenges, and peer-to-peer learning tools. The objective is to foster a more interactive and social learning environment, thereby increasing user retention and engagement through gamification and community-driven content.
